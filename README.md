Developed Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest models to predict NBA player salaries for the 2022â€“23 season and trained a stacked ensemble for enhanced predictive performance. Also built a Python web app that predicts NBA player salaries based on user-inputted statistics such as points, assists, rebounds, and age using these models. The app can be used to predict future free agent contracts, determine overpaid/underpaid players, and analyze the most important factors in determining NBA salaries, among other uses.
